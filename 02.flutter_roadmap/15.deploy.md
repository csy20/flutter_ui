- ✅ App icons and screenshots
- ✅ Privacy policy and app description

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Prepare Your App for Release

### 1.1 Update App Configuration

**`android/app/build.gradle`**
```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 34
    ndkVersion flutter.ndkVersion

    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.yourcompany.yourapp"  // ← Change this to your unique ID
        minSdkVersion 21                         // ← Minimum Android version
        targetSdkVersion 34                      // ← Target latest Android
        versionCode 1                            // ← Increment for each release
        versionName "1.0.0"                      // ← Version visible to users

        testInstrumentationRunner "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
    }

    signingConfigs {
        release {
            keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
            storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
            storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
        }
    }

    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            shrinkResources true
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```

### 1.2 Update pubspec.yaml

**`pubspec.yaml`**
```yaml
name: your_app_name
description: A beautiful Flutter application.
publish_to: 'none'

version: 1.0.0+1  # version+build_number

environment:
  sdk: '>=3.0.0 <4.0.0'

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  
  # App icon configuration
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
```

### 1.3 Add App Icon

Install flutter_launcher_icons package:
```bash
flutter pub add --dev flutter_launcher_icons
```

**`pubspec.yaml`** (add this configuration):
```yaml
flutter_icons:
  android: "launcher_icon"
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/icon/app_icon.png"  # 1024x1024 PNG
  min_sdk_android: 21
  adaptive_icon_background: "#ffffff"
  adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/icon/app_icon_foreground.png"
```

Generate icons:
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

---

## 🔐 Step 2: Create App Signing Key

### 2.1 Generate Keystore File

**On Windows:**
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore c:\Users\USER_NAME\upload-keystore.jks -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

**Fill out the information:**
```
What is your first and last name? → Your Name
What is the name of your organizational unit? → Your Company
What is the name of your organization? → Your Organization
What is the name of your City or Locality? → Your City
What is the name of your State or Province? → Your State
What is the two-letter country code for this unit? → US
```

⚠️ **Important**: Save the keystore file and passwords securely! You'll need them for all future updates.

### 2.2 Configure Key Properties

Create **`android/key.properties`**:
```properties
storePassword=YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=C:/Users/YOUR_NAME/upload-keystore.jks
```

**Add to `.gitignore`**:
```gitignore
# Keystore files
android/key.properties
*.jks
*.keystore
```

### 2.3 Configure Gradle for Signing

**`android/app/build.gradle`** (add at the top):
```gradle
def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('key.properties')
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}

android {
    // ... existing code
}
```

---

## 📱 Step 3: Configure App Permissions

### 3.1 Update AndroidManifest.xml

**`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.yourcompany.yourapp">

    <!-- Internet permission (most apps need this) -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    
    <!-- Camera permission (if your app uses camera) -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
    
    <!-- Storage permissions (if your app saves files) -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

    <application
        android:label="Your App Name"
        android:name="${applicationName}"
        android:icon="@mipmap/launcher_icon">
        
        <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            android:exported="true"
            android:launchMode="singleTop"
            android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme"
            android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|locale|layoutDirection|fontScale|screenLayout|density|uiMode"
            android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
            android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
            
            <meta-data
              android:name="io.flutter.embedding.android.NormalTheme"
              android:resource="@style/NormalTheme" />
              
            <intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
        
        <meta-data
            android:name="flutterEmbedding"
            android:value="2" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

## 🏗️ Step 4: Build Release APK/AAB

### 4.1 Build App Bundle (Recommended)

```bash
# Clean previous builds
flutter clean

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build App Bundle (AAB) - Google's preferred format
flutter build appbundle --release
```

**Output location**: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### 4.2 Build APK (Alternative)

```bash
# Build APK
flutter build apk --release
```

**Output location**: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

### 4.3 Build Split APKs (For different architectures)

```bash
# Build split APKs for different architectures
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release
```

This creates separate APKs for:
- `app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk` (32-bit ARM)
- `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk` (64-bit ARM)
- `app-x86_64-release.apk` (64-bit Intel)

---

## 🎮 Step 5: Test Your Release Build

### 5.1 Install and Test APK

```bash
# Install on connected device
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Or install specific architecture

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "You uploaded an APK that is not zip aligned"
**Solution**: Ensure you're building with `--release` flag
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### Issue 2: "Your app bundle contains native code but no upload was made"
**Solution**: Add signing configuration to `build.gradle`

### Issue 3: "App not optimized for Android"
**Solution**: Use App Bundle (AAB) instead of APK
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### Issue 4: "Missing privacy policy"
**Solution**: Create and host a privacy policy, then link it in Play Console

### Issue 5: "Target API level requirements"
**Solution**: Update `targetSdkVersion` in `build.gradle` to latest (34)

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Version Management
- Use semantic versioning (1.0.0)
- Increment build numbers for each upload
- Keep release notes detailed and user-friendly

### 2. Testing
- Test on multiple devices before release
- Use Firebase Test Lab for automated testing
- Beta test with internal testers first

### 3. Store Optimization (ASO)
- Use relevant keywords in app title and description
- Create compelling screenshots
- Encourage positive reviews
- Respond to user feedback promptly

### 4. Security
- Never commit keystore files to version control
- Use secure password management
- Enable Play App Signing for additional security
